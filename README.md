# Brokey

I had some of my macbook air's keys (escape and zero, which is closing bracket too) broken, and I'm too lazy to fix them.
Instead I made this tray app, that copies broken keys' symbols to clipboard.

## Usage

Press `⌘ + F11` to copy `0` in clipboard, `⌘ + F10` to copy `)`. If you use media keys (volume up / down), you have to press `fn` key as well.

## Development

Run `npm install && npm start` command to launch the app.
